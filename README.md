# Genetic Algorithm for Job-shop Scheduling Problem

Job-shop Scheduling Problem involves scheduling a set of jobs J = {J1, J2, ..., Jn} on a set of machines M = {M1, M2, ..., Mk}, where each job Ji has a specific set of operations Oi = {O1, O2, â€¦, Om} that needs to be processed each on certain machine in a specific order, and each machine Mk can only process one operation at a time. The goal is to find an optimal schedule that minimizes the makespan which is the time it takes for all jobs to be completed.

The idea of our project is to solve the Job-shop Scheduling Problem using a genetic algorithm.
